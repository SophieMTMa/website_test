            <p>I was the leader of our team, Codeherlics, and we created an app called ResQLearn to tackle the issue of the lack of emergency knowledge taught in our traditional education system. We designed a conventional emergency gamification skills education ResQ Learn for children to learn vital rescue techniques in fun and innovative ways. The overall app consists of the following features: Emergency guides, Preparedness checklists, and Interactive simulators.

            <p>As a passionate advocate for equality and community improvement, I am deeply committed to breaking the stigma surrounding periods in our community. Recognizing the urgent need to address period poverty, I initiated the "Pad-in-the-Bathroom" proposal, which aims to provide essential products where they're needed most. By coordinating educational events with local NGOs, like Free Periods HK, organizing fundraisers, and crafting informative social media campaigns, I've seen a remarkable shift in dialogue around this often-silenced issue. I'm proud to say that our efforts have ignited meaningful conversations, fostering a more empathetic and supportive community for all.

            <p>Recognizing that change in high school alone isn't sufficient, I understood the importance of reaching middle school girls during their transitional phase. It's crucial for us as leaders to not only educate them about periods but also to foster a safe and open environment for discussing these important topics. I founded the Middle School Club to empower young girls to share their experiences and challenges regarding menstruation. Together, we advocate for menstrual health and work to dismantle stigma, creating a supportive community that nurtures understanding and empathy for generations to come.

It was incredibly rewarding to share my knowledge and empower my peers to navigate technology with confidence. I guided our community through the Google to Microsoft transition, led my team in crafting informative social media posts to enhance tech usage, and mentored young leaders. Each interaction reinforced my commitment to helping others succeed in their tech journeys, creating a supportive community where everyone could learn and grow together, and deepening my belief that technology is to be used for social good and community empowerment.
