            <p>During my internship at an AI market research company, I helped create a Cantonese LLM for HKGov. I sourced data, performed web scraping, and developed a data-cleaning pipeline that boosted our team’s efficiency. This deepened my understanding of AI's real-world applications and showed how technology can bridge communication gaps meaningfully.

            <p>I was the leader of our team, Codeherlics, and we created an app called ResQLearn to tackle the issue of the lack of emergency knowledge taught in our traditional education system. We designed a conventional emergency gamification skills education ResQ Learn for children to learn vital rescue techniques in fun and innovative ways. The overall app consists of the following features: Emergency guides, Preparedness checklists, and Interactive simulators.
